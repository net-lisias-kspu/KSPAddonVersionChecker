## Description

This system is a spawn from [Tyrope's endevours on this threa](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/64863-python-all-osksp-avc-kerbal-space-program-add-on-version-checker/&tab=comments#comment-992774)d.

After seeing the moderate take-up of a `.version` file format and the subsequent enthusiasm fall off. The original author's thoughts were that a true `.version` system had to be created for it to even have a chance to sticking around. Not just for plugin developers and users which could type up a JSON file by hand in seconds, but also the artists and parts creators as well. It is all well and good to have external applications which manage your mods, but there has to be a more integrated solution for wide spread use. This is where KSP-AVC plugin comes in, as it does all of the `.version` file checks from within the game. If any issues are found, they will be displayed to the player in a convenient way. An extension of the `.version` file has also been made to include an optional download field for use with this plugin.
